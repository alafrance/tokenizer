# Token Usage Guide

## Introduction
This documentation provides instructions on how to use the ERC-20 token that i created.

## Transferring Tokens
- **Wallet ERC-20 support**: As i say before, i use Metamask to have a ethereum wallet that support my token too.  
So to transfer tokens, you'll need to have a same wallet that support ERC-20 tokens (Metamask, Rabby Wallet, etc...)
And with this wallet you can send tokens to another address by using the interface

## Checking Balance
- **[Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/token/0xb5143adfb361c99cee17e474406fad189e28b56b?a=0x2cafb098f01d9199c04481cc3875c3acf4bf8da0)**:
As i mention in the Readme, this website visualize any transaction on Ethereum blockchain, so you can see the balance of my token

You can see each transfer on my token in the section "Transfers"

## Minting and Burning
- **Minting**: Only the contract owner can mint new tokens. And he can uses an IDEA or etherscan to do it.
- **Burning**: Like the minting, only the contract owner can burn tokens. And he can uses an IDEA or etherscan to do it.
